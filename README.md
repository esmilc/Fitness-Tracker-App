# Fitness-Tracker-App

1) Work on the database

Ideas for Logic:
- User adds workouts that gets pushed into database right there, but include a delete feature
- Every workout can be saved into a workout class instance
- a list of classes can be held, when user chooses too all of the workouts are saved into the database and the list is cleared
- Let there be a feature to discover workouts, meaning instructions are showed, you can search them by name, or search by muscle group and intensity
- do different accounts (not for now)
- look into JSON values
- foreign keys (for user)
- .gitignore
- NEVER STORE API KEY
